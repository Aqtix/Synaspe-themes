Important Read:

- DO NOT EDIT path unless you are changing .png to .gif etc

1) Edit the theme setting found in the Synapse Folder and open with notepad or notepad++ I recommend using notepad++
2) The text you mainly would like to change is:

- Loading -- The text at the loading screen 
- Version -- The version color
- PointerColor -- This changes the text color when you write your own scripts // MainBodyUI Color text.
- MinimizeButton -- The Minimize button at the top
- CloseButton - The close button
